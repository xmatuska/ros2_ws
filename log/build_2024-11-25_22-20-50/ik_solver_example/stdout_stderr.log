[31mCMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:11 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findabb_irb4600_ikfast.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this
  project has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by
  "abb_irb4600_ikfast", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by
  "abb_irb4600_ikfast" with any of the following names:

    abb_irb4600_ikfastConfig.cmake
    abb_irb4600_ikfast-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "abb_irb4600_ikfast" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or
  set "abb_irb4600_ikfast_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above
  files.  If "abb_irb4600_ikfast" provides a separate development package or
  SDK, be sure it has been installed.
